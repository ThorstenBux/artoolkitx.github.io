            <div class="mainText">
              ArtoolkitX is a new open-source project that provides tools for building augmented reality applications. It incorporates code from the most recent open-source release of the popular ARToolKit, version 5.3, alongside new code developed by artoolkitX project engineers, and code contributed by and licensed from third-party developers.
                <br/><br/>
                <h4>How does artoolkitX differ from ARToolKit v5.3?</h4>
                artoolkitX incorporates a variety of advanced open-source augmented reality technologies, including                
                <ul>
                    <li>new types of tracking</li>
                    <li>support for operating-system provided frameworks such as Apple's ARKit and Google's ARCore</li>
                    <li>support for low-cost and open-source hardware, including the Raspberry Pi</li>
                    <li>future additions to come, possibly including multi-user virtual environments, ambient sensing, high-fidelity virtual environments, and tangible user interaction.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Who is behind artoolkitX?</h4> 
                The artoolkitX project is being run by several highly experienced engineers and businesspeople with experience in helping build ARToolKit and develop a thriving community around it. You can read more about the team [here](about.md).
                <br>
                Financial support for the project is provided by [Realmax](http://realmax.com), China's leading AR hardware provider.
                
                <h4>When will artoolkitX be released?</h4>
                We are aiming for a version 1.0 release, obviously including full source, in Q1 2018.
                
                <h4>Will you be supporting the existing ARToolKit community?</h4>
