        <p>I am a motivated individual who enjoys technological projects that involve a lot of abstract thinking and reliance on the interdisciplinary skills which I have developed whilst working toward my personal goals.</p>
        <p>
        In recent years I have developed a great deal of experience with Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Web Development.
        I am very interested in machine learning and the potential applications of large scale learning solutions. In
        particular, I see the potential of these problem solving solutions as a means to creating a better world.</p>

        With more than seven years of work experience in information technology, I have a profound knowledge in software engineering and solution design. In the last two years, I created life-changing products using Augmented Reality and shaped ARToolKit5 and ARToolKit6. Before that I took pride in realizing Internet of Things (IoT) products for various industries.</p>
        <p>
        With all I do, I believe in empowering people. I believe in inspiring products. I empower people is by designing solutions which are easy to understand, inspiring and exciting to use. I aim to create outstanding software.</p>
